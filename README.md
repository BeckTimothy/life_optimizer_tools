applied mathematics to answer all of our questions.

I have had the idea for years but it is just a lot of code to write. I'm using LLMs to do a lot of the initial coding, and though I am a fan of good languages such as LISP, Julia, and C++ I am going to initially do this in Python for POC and easy iteration.
