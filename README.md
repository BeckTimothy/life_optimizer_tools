Tools to answer all of our optimization questions.

A multi-agentic AI using LLMs to decide how to improve your life based on the information you give it. 

I have had the idea for years but it is just a lot of code to write. I'm using LLMs to do a lot of the initial coding, and though I am a fan of good languages such as LISP, Julia, and C++ I am going to initially do this in Python for POC and easy iteration by LLMs, since the majority of the code they are trained on is going to be in Python. 

I'm starting with a tool to decide which projects have the best return for my homestead. Once I figure out which mathematical models are the simplest and most efficient for each type of optimization then I can abstract the process and make a tool to make optimization tools for different types of problems.
